Project Charter - Simple IP Principles to Keep in Mind
------------------------------------------------------

1.  Everything in this GitHub repository is governed by the Collaboration Agreement signed by the Parties
on [X], 2020
2.  DO NOT upload anything that you consider proprietary or that cannot be publicly disclosed.
3.  Everything will be open sourced under the permissive Apache 2.0 license.  This is a farily equitable 
license that affords some degree of protection, and facilitates collaboration with the open source community
as it permits contributions to continue to be made available under the Apache 2.0 license.

That's it!
