Project Charter - Simple IP Principles to Keep in Mind
------------------------------------------------------

1.  Everything in this GitHub repository is governed by the Collaboration Agreement signed by the Parties
on [X], 2020
2.  Everything in "Party_A_IP" belongs to Party A, as desribed in the Collaboration Agreement
3.  Everything in "Party_B_IP" belongs to Party B, as described in the Collaboration Agreement
4.  Everything else is owned by Party A, but Party B is entitled to a broad license (tantamount to ownership), again,
as described in the Collaboration Agreement

That's it!
